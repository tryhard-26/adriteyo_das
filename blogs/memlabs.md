## Introduction to MemLabs

Before we dive into the challenge, let me introduce you to **MemLabs** - an excellent collection of CTF-style memory forensics challenges created by Abhiram Kumar ([@stuxnet999](https://github.com/stuxnet999)). MemLabs is specifically designed for those who want to practice and hone their memory analysis skills in a structured, progressively challenging environment.

The project features six main labs (Lab 1 through Lab 6), each presenting unique scenarios ranging from basic process analysis to complex multi-stage investigations. What makes MemLabs special is its educational approach - the challenges are realistic, well-documented, and perfect for both beginners and intermediate practitioners.

**MemLabs Repository**: [https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs/tree/master)

Today, we'll be tackling **Lab 6: The Reckoning** - widely considered one of the most comprehensive and challenging scenarios in the collection. This challenge will test our ability to correlate artifacts across multiple sources, think like an investigator, and leverage various Volatility plugins to reconstruct a complete narrative.

## Challenge Overview: Lab 6 - The Reckoning

### The Scenario

We've received a memory dump from the Intelligence Bureau Department. According to their briefing, this evidence might contain secrets belonging to **David Benjamin**, an underworld gangster who's been on law enforcement's radar for quite some time. 

The memory dump was captured from one of David's associates - a worker who was apprehended by the FBI earlier this week. Our role as digital forensic investigators is to analyze this memory snapshot and uncover any incriminating evidence that could help build a case against the criminal organization.

The FBI has provided us with one crucial lead: **David communicated with his workers via the internet**. This hint suggests we should pay special attention to network artifacts, browser activity, and online communication channels.

### Challenge Specifications

- **Challenge Name**: MemLabs Lab 6 - The Reckoning

- **Difficulty**: Advanced

### Challenge Description (Official)

> *"We received this memory dump from the Intelligence Bureau Department. They say this evidence might hold some secrets of the underworld gangster David Benjamin. This memory dump was taken from one of his workers whom the FBI busted earlier this week. Your job is to go through the memory dump and see if you can figure something out. FBI also says that David communicated with his workers via the internet so that might be a good place to start."*
>
> *Note: This challenge is composed of 1 flag split into 2 parts.*

## Investigation Strategy

Before we begin our analysis, let's outline our investigative approach. Based on the scenario and our knowledge of the available plugins, here's our game plan:

1. **System Identification**: Determine the OS profile using `windows.info`
2. **Process Survey**: Get an overview of running processes with `pslist` and `pstree`
3. **Internet Activity Focus**: Since the hint mentions internet communication, we'll prioritize:
   - Browser processes (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Edge)
   - Network connections with `netscan`
   - Browser history and artifacts
4. **Suspicious Process Investigation**: Examine any unusual processes with `cmdline` and `handles`
5. **File Analysis**: Look for interesting files using `filescan` and extract them with `dumpfiles`
6. **Environmental Clues**: Check environment variables with `envars` for hidden data
7. **Artifact Correlation**: Connect the dots between different pieces of evidence

Let's begin our investigation!

## Part 1: Finding the First Flag Fragment


As with any memory forensics investigation, we start by identifying the operating system profile:

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw windows.info
```

 The system is running **Windows 7 SP1 x64**. This information is crucial as it tells us we're dealing with a 64-bit architecture and helps Volatility correctly parse kernel structures.

```

Scanning through the output, several processes immediately catch our attention:

- **chrome.exe** (PID: 1804) - Google Chrome browser
- **firefox.exe** (PID: 2648) - Mozilla Firefox browser  
- **WinRAR.exe** (PID: 3012) - Archive compression utility
- **cmd.exe** (PID: 1648) - Command prompt

The presence of two different browsers is interesting, it suggests the user may have been compartmentalizing their activities or switching between browsers for different purposes. The WinRAR process indicates file compression/extraction activity, and the cmd.exe process suggests command-line operations were performed.

Given the FBI's hint about internet communication, the browser processes are our primary targets. However, WinRAR is also noteworthy - criminals often use archives to package data for exfiltration or to receive encrypted materials.

Since we identified Chrome as one of the active browsers, let's investigate its browsing history. For this, we'll use a specialized Volatility plugin called **chromehistory**.

#### Understanding the ChromeHistory Plugin

The `chromehistory` plugin is a community-contributed tool that specifically targets Google Chrome's in-memory artifacts. Here's how it works:

- Chrome stores browsing history in an SQLite database (`History` file)
- When Chrome is running, portions of this database are loaded into memory
- The plugin locates the chrome.exe process in memory
- It scans for SQLite database structures and Chrome-specific data patterns
- Extracts URLs, visit times, page titles, and transition types
- Reconstructs the browsing timeline

 Even if the user cleared their browser history from disk, the in-memory cached data might still be recoverable from a memory dump, making this technique invaluable for investigations.

**Installation Note**: ChromeHistory is a third-party plugin. You can obtain it from community repositories:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/superponible/volatility-plugins
volatility --plugins=/path/to/plugins -f dump.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 chromehistory
```

For Volatility 3, similar functionality can be achieved through custom plugins or by using Volatility 2 for this specific task.

Let's run the plugin:

```bash
volatility --plugins=/path/to/vplug -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 chromehistory
```

We analyse the output and this reveals a visit to a Pastebin-like URL:

```
https://pastebin.com/RSGSi1hk
```



This URL is our first major lead. Let's see what's in that paste.

---


When we access the Pastebin link (or if we extract it from memory strings), we discover it contains another URL - a Google Docs link:

```
https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lptcksPt1l_w7Y29V4o6vkEnHToAPqiCkgNNZfS9rCk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1566208765722000&usg=AFQjCNHXd6Ck6F22MNQEsxdZo21JayPKug
```

---

### Step 5: Examining the Google Document

Following the Google Docs link, we find a document that contains yet another clue - a **Mega.nz cloud storage link**:

```
https://mega.nz/#!SrxQxYTQ
```
**But there's a problem**: The Mega link is incomplete. Mega.nz uses a specific URL format:
```
https://mega.nz/#!<file_id>!<decryption_key>
```

We have the file ID (`SrxQxYTQ`) but we're missing the decryption key that comes after the second exclamation mark. Without this key, we cannot decrypt and download the file from Mega.

The document also contains a cryptic message:
> *"But David sent the key in mail. The key is... :("*

 The decryption key was supposedly sent via email, but we don't have access to the email client's memory or messages. We need to find this key somewhere in the memory dump.

---


At this point, we've hit a roadblock. Traditional Volatility plugins haven't revealed the decryption key. 

The document mentioned "The key is..." - let's search for that exact phrase in the raw memory dump:

```bash
strings MemoryDump_Lab6.raw | grep -i "The key is"
```


 The grep command returns:

```bash
The key is: zyWxCjCYYSEMA-hZe552qWVXiPwa5TecODbjnsscMIU
```
When David's associate opened the email containing the key, the email client (likely webmail in a browser) loaded the message into memory. Even though we can't access the structured email data, the raw text remained in memory and was captured in the dump.

 This demonstrates a crucial concept in memory forensics - *persistence of data*. Data doesn't immediately disappear from RAM when it's closed or deleted. It remains until that memory region is overwritten by other processes.

---


Now armed with the complete Mega.nz URL, we can download the file:

```
https://mega.nz/#!SrxQxYTQ!zyWxCjCYYSEMA-hZe552qWVXiPwa5TecODbjnsscMIU
```

The file downloads as: **flag1.png**

However,  The image won't open! The file appears to be corrupted.

![corrupt](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry-YBUQe-x.png)

---


When a file won't open, the first thing to check is the file header (also called "magic bytes"). Let's examine the PNG file with a hex editor:

```bash
xxd flag_.png | head -20
```


![hex_corrupted](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hyw9rUQg-l.png)


A valid PNG file should have this header structure:
```
89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A  [PNG signature - 8 bytes]
00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52  [IHDR chunk - Image Header]
             ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^
             I  H  D  R
```

However, our file shows:
```
89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A  [PNG signature - correct]
00 00 00 0D 69 48 44 52  [iHDR chunk - WRONG]
             ^^
             69 = 'i' (lowercase)
```
 At byte offset `0x0C`, we have `69` (lowercase 'i') instead of `49` (uppercase 'I'). This single byte corruption prevents the entire image from being recognized as valid.

This could be:
- Intentional obfuscation by David's organization
- Transmission error
- Anti-forensics technique
- Simple file corruption

---



Let's fix the corrupted byte using a hex editor (HxD, 010 Editor, or `hexedit`):

1. Open `flag1.png` in your hex editor
2. Navigate to offset `0x0C` (or byte position 12)
3. Change `69` to `49`
4. Save the file

Now let's open the repaired image:


![flag_](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1P3H8XxZl.png)

**Success!** The image displays the first part of our flag:

```
inctf{thi5_cH4LL3Ng3_!s_g0nn4_b3_
```


## Part 2: Finding the Second Flag Fragment


Remember the WinRAR.exe process we spotted earlier in our process list? Let's investigate what file it was working with. We'll use the `cmdline` plugin to see the command-line arguments:

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw windows.cmdline
```

Filtering for WinRAR:

```bash
PID: 3012
Process: WinRAR.exe
CommandLine: "C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe" "C:\Users\Jaffa\Desktop\flag.rar"
```

The user (username: Jaffa) opened a RAR archive called `flag.rar` from the Desktop. This archive likely contains the second part of our flag!

Let's scan memory for the RAR file:

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw windows.filescan | grep -i ".rar"
```
```
Offset: 0x000000005fcfc4b0
Path: \Users\Jaffa\Desktop\flag.rar
```

Now let's extract it using dumpfiles:

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw -o output_dir windows.dumpfiles --virtaddr 0x000000005fcfc4b0
```


The file is successfully dumped! Let's try to extract its contents:

```bash
unrar x file.0x5fcfc4b0.dat
```

**Problem**:
```
Enter password (will not be echoed):
```

The RAR archive is password-protected. We need to find the password.


Let's examine the environment variables for all processes, particularly focusing on WinRAR:

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw windows.envars
```

Filtering for WinRAR (PID 3012):

Among the standard Windows environment variables, we find a custom variable:

```
PID: 3012
Process: WinRAR.exe
Variable: RAR_password
Value: easypeasyvirus
```

 Someone (likely David's associate, or David himself) stored the RAR password in an environment variable for easy access. This is a significant operational security failure that just gave us exactly what we need!


---


Now let's extract the RAR archive with our newfound password:

```bash
unrar x file.0x5fcfc4b0.dat
# Password: easypeasyvirus
```

The archive extracts a png: `flag2.png`

Opening it we find our second flag!

![flag2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1NTHIme-l.png)

It is ```aN_Am4zINg_!_i_gU3Ss???_}```


We now have both parts of the flag. Let's combine them:


```
inctf{thi5_cH4LL3Ng3_!s_g0nn4_b3_aN_Am4zINg_!_i_gU3Ss???_}
```


And thus we used memory forensics to solve this!
